# PsychedBox — First Story Outreach List
*Compiled February 2026 — Realistic targets for a new brand*

---

## Strategy Notes
- **Target profile:** 500–30K followers. Engaged, mission-aligned, likely to appreciate the concept of being immortalized in puzzle art and having 10% donated to them.
- **Avoid for now:** DoubleBlind, Third Wave, MAPS (too large, too formal — revisit after 3+ boxes exist)
- **Angle:** Lead with the mission + the 10% direct payment to them. This isn't just a feature — they get paid and get a puzzle portrait made of them. That's the hook.
- **Best channels:** Instagram DM first to warm them up, then email to close.

## TIER 1 — Best Fit (New Brand Friendly, Mission-Aligned)

### 1. Fireside Project
- **What they do:** Psychedelic peer support hotline. Founded by Joshua Golding.
- **Why they fit:** Community-first, grassroots, exactly our vibe. Already a donation partner.
- **Contact:** firesideproject.org (contact form) / Instagram: @firesideproject
- **Approach:** "We already donate to you — we'd love to feature one of your team members or ambassadors as our first puzzle portrait. 10% of our revenues from that month go directly to them."
- **Realistic? Yes** — they're accessible and would appreciate the visibility.

### 2. DanceSafe
- **What they do:** Harm reduction nonprofit. Testing kits, festival presence, education.
- **Why they fit:** Grassroots, community-trusted, already a donation partner. Their staff/volunteers are exactly the type of advocates we want to feature.
- **Contact:** dsusa@dancesafe.org / media: dancesafe.org/media-room / Instagram: @dancesafe
- **Approach:** Feature a DanceSafe volunteer or chapter lead. Harm reduction advocate as first puzzle portrait is a powerful statement.
- **Realistic? Yes** — mid-size org, approachable.

### 3. The Zendo Project

- **Why they fit:** Intimate community, deeply mission-aligned, already a donation partner.

### 4. Heroic Hearts Project

## TIER 2 — Independent Creators & Advocates (Instagram-First)

### 5. @themushroommom (Sasha Rincón)
- **Platform:** Instagram ~15–25K
- **What she does:** Harm reduction advocate, mother, psilocybin decrim activist. Very personal, authentic storytelling.
- **Why they fit:** Relatable, community-loved, strong story. Perfect "everyday advocate" first feature.
- **Contact:** Instagram DM → bio link / email in bio
- **Approach:** "We want to turn your portrait into a puzzle and share your story with our subscribers. You get 10% of that month's revenue."

### 6. @psychedelic.feminist
- **Platform:** Instagram ~5–15K
- **What she does:** Intersectional advocacy — psychedelics, feminism, mental health, equity.
- **Why they fit:** Underrepresented voice, highly engaged community, strong story potential.
- **Contact:** Instagram DM
- **Approach:** Lead with the equity angle — PsychedBox wants to center voices that are often overlooked in the psychedelic space.

### 7. @integration.coach (various handles in this niche)
- **What they do:** Psychedelic integration coaches — help people process experiences. Growing niche on Instagram.
- **Why they fit:** Advocates doing real community work, often 1–10K followers, very approachable.

- **Tip:** Search "#psychedelicintegration" on Instagram and look for coaches with 1K–10K followers who post personal content.

### 8. @mycology_art / psychedelic visual artists
- **What they do:** Artists creating psychedelic/mycology-inspired work. Many on Instagram 2K–20K.
- **Why they fit:** The puzzle IS art — featuring an artist whose medium is psychedelic art is on-the-nose perfect.
- **Contact:** Instagram DM
- **Search terms:** #psychedelicart #mycologyart #fungalart #tripart
- **Approach:** "We want to turn you — the artist — into art."

### 9. @bicycleday.official / Tricycle Day community

## TIER 3 — Publications (Pitch a Story / Cross-Promotion)

### 10. Psychedelic Spotlight
- **What they are:** Independent psychedelic news publication
- **Contact:** info@psychedelicspotlight.com
- **Approach:** Pitch them a story about PsychedBox as a business — "New subscription box puts community advocates at the center." They cover industry news and would cover a new brand with a mission angle.
- **Realistic? Yes** — indie pub, open to pitches.

### 11. Lucid News
- **What they are:** Independent psychedelic journalism, ethics-forward.
- **Contact:** Contact form at lucid.news/contact
- **Approach:** Same — pitch the business story + the giveback model. They care about ethical, community-centered business.
- **Realistic? Yes** — small editorial team, approachable.

### 12. Psychedelic Science Review
- **What they are:** Science-focused psychedelic publication
- **Contact:** psychedelicreview.com
- **Approach:** Less of a fit for a first story feature, but worth a pitch on the harm reduction / education angle of your mission.
- **Realistic? Possibly**
